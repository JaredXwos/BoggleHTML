# BoggleHTML
[Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a word game played competitively internationally. It involves finding as many distinct words as possible on a grid of letter dice. The words must be formed of connected, non repeating dice. As this tool is primarily meant for boggle players participating in the NTU Interhalls Recreational Games, it follows that NTU Boggle Charter: A 3 minute game over a 4x4 board with points earned defined by charter, using the [CSW24](https://www.cocoscrabble.org/news/new-csw24-lexicon) dictionary, and the Q die face may be taken as a Q, or a Qu (not u).

To play, one just downloads this html page and opens it with any browser. You do not need an interconnection after you have downloaded the page.
